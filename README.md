## Project Overview

**SCRIBBLR AI** is a fully responsive, feature-rich landing page for an AI writing assistant built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases a polished SaaS-style interface with interactive demos, tab-based content switching, simulated AI text generation, rewriting and grammar checking, and a chatbot-style assistant — all without real backend or API integration.

The project focuses on **modern front-end practices**, **UI/UX flow**, **DOM manipulation**, and **interactive components**, making it a strong demonstration of landing page design and JavaScript-driven functionality using only core web technologies.
